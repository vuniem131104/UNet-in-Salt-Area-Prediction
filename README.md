## Introduction 
- Use a deep learning model in pytorch to deal with Salt Area Prediction
## Dataset
- I use the [TGS Salt Segmentation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge). The dataset was introduced as part of the TGS Salt Identification Challenge on Kaggle
- I use a sub-part of this dataset which comprises 4000 images of size 101Ã—101 pixels, taken from various locations on earth. Here, each pixel corresponds to either salt deposit or sediment. In addition to images, i am also provided with the ground-truth pixel-level segmentation masks of the same dimension as the image

- The white pixels in the masks represent salt deposits, and the black pixels represent sediment. I aim to correctly predict the pixels that correspond to salt deposits in the images. Thus, I have a binary classification problem where I have to classify each pixel into one of the two classes, Class 1: Salt or Class 2: Not Salt (or, in other words, sediment).
## Model
- I use UNet model and here is its architecture:

## Train
- The model is trained for 40 epochs on CPU only (saved in output/unet_tgs_salt.pth) and if you want to train more, you can set up EPOCHS in config.py
